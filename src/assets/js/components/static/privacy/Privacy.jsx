      	<div className="updated">Last updated December 5, 2016</div>

      	<div className="copy intro">
		      	At Avaea, we want to give you a fantastic travel experience. As part of that effort, we want you to feel
		      	comfortable when you visit or use our Service (the websites and related mobile apps on which this 
		      	Privacy Policy is displayed, and the services that we make available though those websites and apps). 
		      	We also understand that you may have some important questions for us about what information we 
		      	collect when you use our Service, why we collect that information, and how we may use and disclose 
		      	it to others. We've created this Privacy Policy to help answer those questions. Please read this 
		      	Privacy Policy carefully. Your access to or use of our Service constitutes your notice to our collection, 
		      	use and disclosure of your information, as described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not wish for us 
		      	to collect, use, and disclose your information in accordance with this Privacy Policy, please do not 
		      	access or use the Service. We may add to or amend this Policy with other notices.
	      	</div>
	
		      <div className="copy intro">
		      	This Policy applies solely to information collected by us through the Services and does not apply to
		      	information collected elsewhere, including, without limitation, offline or on sites linked to or through 
		      	the Services.
      	 </div>


      	<div className="subti">What Information Is Collected?</div> 


      	<strong>Here's what we collect from you when you use the Service:</strong>

      	<ul>

      	<li>
	      	<strong>User-Provided Information:</strong> When you use the Service, and specifically when you do things like enter 
	      	a search query, register for the Service, or create a user profile, you may be required to provide certain 
	      	forms of information. For example, when you search for a flight to London you would need to enter your 
	      	destination city (San London) and other information, like your origination city and your travel dates. 
	      	When you fully register for the Service, we also ask you to provide an e-mail address and to select a password. 
	      	You may also need to enter information that would be considered "personally identifiable" 
	      	(that is, information that would allow us to directly identify you, such as your name, e-mail address, 
	      	mailing address, and/or telephone number).
      	</li>

      	<li>
      		<p>
		      	<strong>Third-Party Login Functionality:</strong> We allow users with accounts on third-party services, such as Facebook 
		      	and Google, to log into the Service using functionality that these third parties provide (such as Facebook 
		      	Connect and Google's OpenID-based authentication mechanism). By using this Facebook or Google 
		      	functionality to log into the Service, you permit us to access and use specific identifying information 
		      	related to your Facebook or Google account. While these services make a variety of information 
		      	available, Avaea will associate only your e-mail address or other unique user account identifier with 
		      	your Avaea account. 
	      	</p>
		      	
		      <p>
			      We may also allow you to integrate various functionalities from other services, such as Microsoft Outlook 
	      	  and Google Calendar, with Avaea. If you choose to take advantage of this integration feature in the 
	      	  desktop version of the Service, we will ask you for your login credentials for the other service. If you 
	      	  access the Service using our mobile apps, you do not need to provide your login credentials, as your 
	      	  mobile device allows this integration automatically. By providing those credentials or installing the 
	      	  mobile apps, you are agreeing that we can access and store the information that the other service's 
	      	  functionality contains, including personally identifiable information. Further, if you have obtained 
	      	  authorized access through the other service to another person's information, you understand and 
	      	  agree that by providing us your login credentials or installing the mobile, you are allowing and are 
	      	  authorized to allow Avaea to access and store that other person's information, including personally 
	      	  identifiable information.
	      	 </p>
      	</li>

      	<li>
	      	<strong>Calendar Information:</strong> With your permission, we collect calendar information from your mobile device 
	      	and use it to provide suggestions (such as for flights, hotels, and cars) based on your meetings and 
	      	travel plans. We also may allow you to integrate various functionalities from other services, such as 
	      	Microsoft Outlook and Google Calendar, with Avaea. If you choose to take advantage of this integration 
	      	feature in the desktop version of the Service, we will ask you for your login credentials for the other 
	      	service. If you access the Service using our mobile apps, you do not need to provide your login 
	      	credentials, as your mobile device allows this integration automatically. By providing those credentials 
	      	or installing the mobile apps, you are agreeing that we can access and store the information that the 
	      	other service's functionality contains, including personally identifiable information. Further, if you have 
	      	obtained authorized access through the other service to another person's information, you understand 
	      	and agree that by providing us your login credentials or installing the mobile, you are allowing and are 
	      	authorized to allow Avaea to access and store that other person's information, including personally 
	      	identifiable information.
      	</li>

      	<li>
	      	<strong>Communications:</strong> When you communicate with us, for example through our Virtual Travel Agent, we may 
	      	collect your email address and the contents of the communication. In addition, we may provide or 
	      	enable communications with you through third party services and those third party services may 
	      	provide us with information about you and the content of your communications. For example, when 
	      	you interact with the Hello Avaea Virtual Travel Agent on a third-party service such as Facebook 
	      	Messenger or Slack, that third-party service may collect your contact information and the content 
	      	of those communications and share this information with Avaea. We do not own or operate these 
	      	third-party services, and you should review the terms of use and privacy policies of such services t
	      	o make sure you are comfortable with the ways in which they use the information you share with 
	      	them.
      	</li>

      	<li>
	      	<strong>"Automatically Collected" Information:</strong> Like many websites and mobile apps, when you use the Service 
	      	we may automatically record certain information about your visit from your web browser or our mobile 
	      	app such as your IP address, the pages of the service you view, or details regarding the searches you 
	      	run on the Service, such as what you are searching for, the date and time when you initiated a search, 
	      	and the location from which you initiated the search. We collect and may use this information to 
	      	understand and analyze the aggregate or "big picture" usage trends and preferences of our users.
      	</li>


      	<li>
	      	<strong>"Cookies" Information:</strong> One form of "automatically collected" information we record is information 
	      	stored by "cookies." When you use the Service, we may send one or more cookies to your computer 
	      	or your mobile device. We use both "session" and "persistent" cookies to collect, store, and sometimes 
	      	track various types of information. A session cookie is one that disappears after you close your browser 
	      	or our mobile app. While a persistent cookie remains after you close your browser or the mobile app 
	      	(and may be used by your browser or the mobile app when you later return to the Service), persistent 
	      	cookies generally can be removed. You can review the appropriate "Help" file in your Web browser or 
	      	your mobile device to learn the proper way to modify your cookie settings. 
      	</li> 

      	<li>
	      	<strong>Device-Provided Information:</strong> If you install our mobile apps to access the Service, your mobile device 
	      	makes certain information from the device and other apps installed on the device, which may include 
	      	personally identifiable information, available to our mobile apps automatically. We may collect, use, 
	      	share, and disclose this information as described in this Privacy Policy. 
      	</li>

      	<li>
	      	<strong>Payment Information:</strong> When we collect billing details from you, including name on card, card number, 
	      	and billing address, we pass that information to our third-party payment processor, Stripe, which 
	      	handles payments for us. We don't store that information—Stripe does. You can find out more about 
	      	Stripe here.  
      	</li>

      	<li>
	      	<strong>Booking through Avaea:</strong> If you are a registered Avaea user, you may book travel transactions with some 
	      	of our travel partners through Avaea. When you use this feature, we collect payment details from 
	      	you including name on card, card number, billing address, expiration date, security code, and 
	      	phone number, and we pass that information to the travel partner to complete the transaction. 
	      	The travel partner processes your payment. You have the option to let us save your payment details, 
	      	which we will store for the sole purpose of enabling your future transactions. You may add a payment 
	      	method or edit or delete your saved payment information at any time in your Avaea account settings. 
      	</li>

      	</ul>

      	<div className="subti">How Avaea uses this information:</div>


      	<div className="copy intro">
	      	Avaea uses the information you provide or that we collect to to develop, operate, maintain, enhance, 
	      	and provide the Service, to develop new products and services, and to customize and target content 
	      	that may be more interesting, relevant or useful to you, including advertisements, and for other 
	      	administrative purposes. Here are some examples of how we may use the information you provide 
	      	or that we collect:
      	</div>			

	      <ul>
	      
      	<li>
	      	We may use your e-mail to give you updates on the Service's features and progress (such as new 
	      	travel-search features or functions that we may add), and to provide you with promotional materials 
	      	and offers (such as discounts on airfare or hotels that may become available, or news about 
	      	travel destinations). Generally, you have the ability to opt-out of receiving e-mails about Service 
	      	updates and promotional materials and offers, either through links provided in the e-mail messages 
	      	we send to you or by updating your account preferences through the Service.
      	</li>	
      		 
      	<li>
      		We may communicate with you via e-mail or another form of electronic notification regarding 
	 		security, privacy, and administrative issues relating to your use of the Service.
		</li>	
			 
      	<li>
	      	If you are logged into your account and using the Service (including Avaea for Business), we may 
	      	associate information regarding your usage of the Service with your account and with other 
	      	information that we have collected about you, such as your search history. If you have not yet 
	      	established an account with us (or you have not signed into the Service using a third-party login 
	      	mechanism, described above), we record the searches you perform to a cookie. If that you later 
	      	establish an account with us, or sign into our Service with that cookie still present on your computer, 
	      	we may associate the searches recorded on that cookie with your new account.

				<div className="sub-copy">
      		We may provide personally identifiable information to third parties for their use in helping us perform 
      		our internal business functions. These are things like processing payments for us, or performing 
      		maintenance, security, data analysis, e-mail transmission and processing, or data hosting on our 
      		behalf. If you book travel with one of our travel partners through Avaea, we provide the payment 
      		details you give us to the travel partner to process the transaction. If you book travel using Avaea 
      		through certain third-party partners, we may, with your consent, send a copy of the travel booking 
      		confirmation to the partner. The confirmation will include personally identifiable information (such as 
      		name, email and phone number, and billing address) and truncated payment card details. We will do 
      		our best to require these third parties to maintain your information securely, to not use it for purposes 
      		other than providing services to us, and to refrain from disclosing the information except when required 
      		by law.
				</div>

				<div className="sub-copy">

      		or unlawful uses or activity; (3) investigate and defend Avaea against any legal claims or threats; 
      		(4) protect and defend the rights or property of Avaea; (5) take action on user complaints, or (6) act 
      		in urgent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of Avaea, the Service, or the public.

				<div className="sub-copy">
      		If there is a change in ownership of Avaea, including through a merger with, acquisition by, or sale of
