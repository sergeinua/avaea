	      	feature that's powered by one of our travel partners, we collect your payment information and pass it on 
	      	to the travel partner to process the transaction, consistent with our Privacy Policy. We don't complete the

	      	Avaea Service in the jurisdiction where you reside or from where you are attempting to access the Avaea 
	      	Service, or (iii) in other reasonable circumstances as determined by Avaea at its discretion. The provisions

      	<div className="sub-copy">
	      	These Terms of Use, together with the Avaea Privacy Policy (which is hereby incorporated by this reference), 
	      	constitute the entire agreement between you and Avaea with respect to your use of the Avaea Service, and

      	<div className="subti">Arbitration</div>

      	<div className="sub-copy">
	      	All disputes between you and Avaea will be resolved by BINDING ARBITRATION as described in more detail in 
	      	the Arbitration Agreement included below. You thus GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or 
	      	defend your rights under this agreement (except for matters that may be taken to small claims court).
	      	Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR and NOT a judge or jury and your claims cannot 
	      	be brought as a class action. You are entitled to a fair hearing, but the arbitration procedures are simpler and 
	      	more limited than they would be in court. Arbitrator decisions are as enforceable as any court order and are 
	      	subject to very limited review by courts or judges.
      	</div>

      	<div className="subti">Arbitration Agreement</div>

      	<div className="sub-copy">
	      	You and Avaea agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating in any way to the Avaea 
	      	Service, our website or user interfaces, or these Terms of Use shall be determined by binding arbitration or 
	      	small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction. You and Avaea agree that this arbitration 
	      	agreement extends to the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate.
	      	Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or 
	      	jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators 
	      	can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Any arbitration under this Agreement will take 
	      	place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted.
      	</div>

      	<div className="sub-copy">
	      	You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and Avaea are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or 
	      	to participate in a class action. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of 
	      	this provision. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement and the termination of 
	      	your use of the Avaea Service.
      	</div>

      	<div className="sub-copy">
	      	If you elect to seek arbitration, you must first send to Avaea, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute 
	      	("Notice"). The Notice to Avaea should be addressed to: Avaea, Attn: Legal, 592 Dory Ln., Redwood Shores, 
	      	CA 94065 ("Notice Address"). The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the 
	      	claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought ("Demand"). If Avaea and you do not reach an 
	      	agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or Avaea may commence 
	      	an arbitration proceeding or file a claim in small claims court. During the arbitration, the amount of any 
	      	settlement offer made by Avaea or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator 
	      	determines the amount, if any, to which you or Avaea is entitled. You may download or copy a form Notice 
	      	and a form to initiate arbitration at www.adr.org.
      	</div>

      	<div className="sub-copy">
	      	After Avaea receives notice at the Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration, it will promptly 
	      	reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than $10,000. 
	      	(The filing fee currently is $125 for claims under $10,000 but is subject to change by the arbitration 
	      	provider. If you are unable to pay this fee, Avaea will pay it directly upon receiving a written request 
	      	at the Notice Address.) The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the 
	      	Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, "AAA Rules") of the American 
	      	Arbitration Association ("AAA"), as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA.

	      	The AAA Rules are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by 
	      	writing to the Notice Address. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement. All issues are 
	      	for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope and enforceability of this arbitration 
	      	agreement. Unless Avaea and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county 
	      	(or parish) of your primary residence. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose 
	      	whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, 
	      	through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim 
	      	exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner 
	      	in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to 
	      	explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. Except as otherwise provided 
	      	for herein, Avaea will pay all AAA filing, administration, and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated in 
	      	accordance with the notice requirements above.

      	<div className="sub-copy">
	      	If, however, the arbitrator finds in favor of Avaea as to 
	      	the substance of your claim or the relief sought, you will reimburse Avaea for your portion of the filing fee. 
	      	If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous 
	      	or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil 
	      	Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all AAA filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed 
	      	by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse Avaea for all monies previously disbursed by it that 
	      	are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. In addition, if you initiate an arbitration in which 
	      	you seek more than $10,000 in damages, the payment of these fees will be governed by the AAA rules.
	      	The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief 
	      	and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.

	      	PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Avaea agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more 
	      	than one person's claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative 
	      	or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration 
	      	provision shall be null and void.

	      	sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to the Arbitration Notice Address provided above. By 
	      	rejecting any such change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with
