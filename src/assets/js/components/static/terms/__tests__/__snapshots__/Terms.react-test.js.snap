      Booking Travel Through Our Travel Partners

      OnVoya offers users the ability to book travel with some of our third-party travel partners through the OnVoya Service. We may require you to create an OnVoya account or connect to the OnVoya Service through your Facebook, Google or Twitter account in order to book travel through one of our travel partners. If you use a booking feature that\'s powered by one of our travel partners, we collect your payment information and pass it on to the travel partner to process the transaction, consistent with our Privacy Policy. We don\'t complete the transaction or process your payment–the travel partner does. You understand and agree that if you encounter any problems with the transaction or with the reservation you book in that transaction, you must resolve your dispute with the travel partner, not with OnVoya, and your sole remedy, including any refund, lies with the travel partner, not with OnVoya.  However, if you cannot reach a satisfactory resolution with one of our travel partners, we want to know and we may, at our sole discretion, intervene on your behalf.

      Arbitration
    </div>
    <div
      className="sub-copy">
      All disputes between you and OnVoya will be resolved by BINDING ARBITRATION as described in more detail in the Arbitration Agreement included below. You thus GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to assert or defend your rights under this agreement (except for matters that may be taken to small claims court). Your rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR and NOT a judge or jury and your claims cannot be brought as a class action. You are entitled to a fair hearing, but the arbitration procedures are simpler and more limited than they would be in court. Arbitrator decisions are as enforceable as any court order and are subject to very limited review by courts or judges.
    </div>
    <div
      className="subti">
      Arbitration Agreement
    </div>
    <div
      className="sub-copy">
      You and OnVoya agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating in any way to the OnVoya Service, our website or user interfaces, or these Terms of Use shall be determined by binding arbitration or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction. You and OnVoya agree that this arbitration agreement extends to the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted.
    </div>
    <div
      className="sub-copy">
      You agree that, by entering into this Agreement, you and OnVoya are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of this Agreement and the termination of your use of the OnVoya Service.
    </div>
    <div
      className="sub-copy">
      If you elect to seek arbitration, you must first send to OnVoya, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (\"Notice\"). The Notice to OnVoya should be addressed to: OnVoya, Attn: Legal, 592 Dory Ln., Redwood Shores, CA 94065 (\"Notice Address\"). The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (\"Demand\"). If OnVoya and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or OnVoya may commence an arbitration proceeding or file a claim in small claims court. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by OnVoya or you shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or OnVoya is entitled. You may download or copy a form Notice and a form to initiate arbitration at www.adr.org.
    </div>
    <div
      className="sub-copy">
      After OnVoya receives notice at the Notice Address that you have commenced arbitration, it will promptly reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for greater than $10,000. (The filing fee currently is $125 for claims under $10,000 but is subject to change by the arbitration provider. If you are unable to pay this fee, OnVoya will pay it directly upon receiving a written request at the Notice Address.) The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, \"AAA Rules\") of the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\"), as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA.
    </div>
    <div
      className="sub-copy">
      The AAA Rules are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by writing to the Notice Address. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including issues relating to the scope and enforceability of this arbitration agreement. Unless OnVoya and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of your primary residence. If your claim is for $10,000 or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. Except as otherwise provided for herein, OnVoya will pay all AAA filing, administration, and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated in accordance with the notice requirements above.
    </div>
    <div
      className="sub-copy">
      If, however, the arbitrator finds in favor of OnVoya as to the substance of your claim or the relief sought, you will reimburse OnVoya for your portion of the filing fee. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all AAA filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, you agree to reimburse OnVoya for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. In addition, if you initiate an arbitration in which you seek more than $10,000 in damages, the payment of these fees will be governed by the AAA rules. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party\'s individual claim.
    </div>
    <div
      className="sub-copy">
      YOU AND ONVOYA AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and OnVoya agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person\'s claims with your claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void.
    </div>
    <div
      className="sub-copy">
      Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if OnVoya makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address), you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to the Arbitration Notice Address provided above. By rejecting any such change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this provision, and agree to promptly cease using the OnVoya Service.
